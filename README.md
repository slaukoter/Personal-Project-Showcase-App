**Task 1: Define the Problem**

Analyze the mock-up design document to understand the project requirements and layout.
Identify the necessary components and their hierarchy based on the design.
Determine the routes needed to manage page layout.
Build out simulated backend within db.json file

**Task 2: Determine the Design**

Create a component tree that outlines the structure of your application, including parent and child components.
Define state and prop relationships within the component tree.
Build mock data that will resemble a product.
The data for this e-commerce site will be up to you! You can make this site sell what you would like, here is an example you can use to get yourself started.
{
"store_info": [
{
"id": 1,
"name": "Coffee R Us",
"description": "The go to store for coffee",
"phone_number": "555-5555"
}
],
"coffee": [
{
"id": 1,
"description": "Medium Roast, nutty flavor",
"name": "Vanilla bean",
"origin": "Columbia",
"price": 10.00
},
{
"id": 2,
"description": "Dark Roast, Rich flavor",
"name": "House Blend",
"origin": "Vietnam",
"price": 12.00
}
]
}
Use the mock-up to finalize the visual layout and flow.

**\*ask 3: Develop the Code**

File Setup
Initialize or clone new React project:
Using create-react-app, vite, or a similar tool.
Using Github
Create a directory structure for components, hooks, styles, and tests.
Routes
Build functional routes and components.
Build navigation between routes.
State Management
Use useState for local state management.
Use useId, useContext, and useRef as necessary.
Implement custom hook.
Data Fetching
Create and fetch data with a get request to display data.
Create post request to add new data.
Create patch request to allow administer to edit data.

**Task 4: Test and Debug**

Write unit tests for key components using Vitest and React Testing Library.
Test user interactions such as form submissions and routing.
Debug errors using browser developer tools and React DevTools.
Refactor for code clarity and maintainability.

**Task 5: Document and Maintain**

Add comments to explain complex logic and structure.
Write a README.md file that:
Provides setup and usage instructions.
Highlights features and any known limitations.
Push your project to GitHub, ensuring the repository is public for review.
